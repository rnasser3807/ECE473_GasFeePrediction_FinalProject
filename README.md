</h1> Ethereum Transaction Predictor </h1>
Welcome to Ethereum Transaction Predictor! This project is designed to help users determine the optimal time to conduct Ethereum transactions by predicting gas fees using an ARIMA model.

Overview
The Ethereum Transaction Predictor consists of a front-end React website interface and a back-end Flask server. The front-end allows users to input transaction details and receive predictions for optimal transaction times and estimated gas fees. The back-end utilizes an ARIMA model to analyze historical gas price data obtained from etherscan.io, enabling it to provide accurate predictions.

Features
Predict Optimal Transaction Time: Users can input transaction details and receive predictions for the best time to conduct their Ethereum transactions.
Estimate Gas Fees: The system provides estimated gas fees in gwei, allowing users to plan their transactions accordingly.
ARIMA Model: The back-end server runs an ARIMA model to analyze historical gas price trends and predict future prices.
Adjustable Multiples Calculations: The model performs adjusted multiples calculations based on observed trends, ensuring accurate predictions.
